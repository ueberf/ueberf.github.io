# Interactive Technology Design Wiki

This is a prototype for the upcoming ITD Wiki page, build with [docsify.js](https://docsify.js.org/#/).

## How it works
Docsify is a site generator, hosted on Github Pages, that turns simple html and markdown into a website.

## How to contribute
The content for the website is written in markdown. While most things (even the site structure) can be changed using purely markdown, sometimes a bit of JavaScript or HTML is required, for instance when initiating plugins. For more help go to [docsify.js](https://docsify.js.org/#/).

### Creating a new Page
1. To create a new page, simply add a new markdown file in the root folder of the github project. To keep it organized, create a new folder for the page category or add it to an existing folder (e.g. Infrastructure, Learning etc.).
2. Add the newly created page to the navigation sidebar by opening `_sidebar.md` create a new entry.
